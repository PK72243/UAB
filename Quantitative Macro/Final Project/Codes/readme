In the folder there is main code file called dsgefinal.
There are also some npy objects that were created by running this code. They can be loaded with the code to spare time.
Unfortunetely, one of the npy objects was too big (around 60 MB), it stores the results of the main simulation that lasted for 3 hours, so if it is needed I can send it to you in some other way.
There are two more python scripts: c, tfp.
The first is used mainly to obtain deviations of consumption that is needed for the main code, the latter provides calculations and graphs for second section of the report.
